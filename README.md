# Left Brain Interpreter

Experimental procedure in [Inquisit] to evaluate the [Gazzaniga]'s [Left Brain Interpreter] theory.

Written by **Krzysztof Kutt** & **Agata Zimirska** as a part of "Neuronalne mechanizmy podmiotowo≈õci" (Neuronal mechanisms of subjectivity) course at Jagiellonian University / [Institute of Psychology] during Spring term 2013/2014.

### How does it work?
 1. One sentence and two words are selected (with no repeats) from the `sentences` and `nouns` lists.
 2. Sentence is displayed on the screen.
 3. Then fixation point (+) is displayed.
 4. That is followed by fixation point (+) and two words (on the left and right of fixation point).
 5. Subject has to select the word that probably describes the motivation for activity described in the sentence.
 6. If answer is not given within the specified time slot, all disappears from the screen and blank screen is displayed until the subject responds.

### Our hypothesis
If left brain interpreter theory describes the reality, left-hand side words should be choosen more frequently. They are in the left field of view, that is observed by left eye and processed by left hemisphere where the interpreter is placed and more quickly do the word-sentence associations.
This link may be moderated by the handedness so we also provide Edinburgh Handedness Inventory authored by R.C. Oldfield.
